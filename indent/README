Klassic Indent file for Vim
=========================

With that said, if there's something you're passionate about and you want it to
be properly indented, and you can't hack it in yourself, then feel free to drop
me a line and we'll fight about it.

    /**
     * The following stuff doesn't work, but honestly, it's pretty
     * pathological stuff... format your code differently.
     *
     * ---- 1. ----
     *
     *    if (b) 1
     *    else
     *      if (c) 2
     *    else 3
     *
     *    Do this instead:
     *
     *    if (b) 1
     *    else {
     *      if (c) 2
     *      else 3
     *    }
     *    
     *
     * ---- 2. ----
     *
     *    if (b) 1
     *    else
     *      if (c)
     *        2
     *        else 3
     *
     *    Do this instead:
     *
     *    if (b) 1
     *    else {
     *      if (c) 2
     *      else 3
     *    }
     *
     *    or this...
     *    
     *    if (b) 1
     *    else {
     *      if (c)
     *        2
     *      else
     *        3
     *    }
     *
     * ---- 3. ----
     *    
     *    if (b) 1
     *    else {
     *      if (c)
     *        2
     *        else 3
     *    }
     *
     *    Do the same as in number 2
     */

In other words, for the forseeable future... do something different to fix the
cases that don't work. :)
